description: Enhancing Long-Term Survivorship Through Digital Phenotyping and Data Visualization in Breast Cancer
---


<hr>

#### Overview

Rebloomlens is a research-driven initiative aimed at supporting long-term survivorship among breast cancer survivors through the integration of digital phenotyping and advanced data visualization techniques. While advances in early diagnosis and treatment have significantly increased breast cancer survival rates, survivors continue to face physical, psychological, and social challenges long after primary treatment ends. Despite the proliferation of mHealth solutions, there is a lack of empirically validated tools tailored to the unique needs of cancer survivors in the post-treatment phase.

To address this gap, Rebloomlens collects digital phenotyping data—capturing behavioral, physical, and emotional indicators—via smartphones and wearable devices. The core of the project is a mobile application that passively and actively tracks lifestyle patterns (e.g., physical activity, sleep, diet), physiological status (e.g., body composition, symptoms), and emotional well-being (e.g., anxiety, fear of recurrence), then visualizes these data streams in an integrated, timeline-based interface. This approach empowers survivors to reflect on their health trajectories, identify meaningful patterns, and engage in proactive self-management.

Rebloomlens is being evaluated through an exploratory randomized controlled trial involving breast cancer survivors who have completed primary treatment. The study will assess the app’s impact on behavioral regularity, physical and emotional status, and self-management efficacy. Ultimately, this project seeks to close the knowledge gap in post-treatment cancer care by providing a validated, user-centered mHealth platform that enhances self-efficacy, quality of life, and long-term health outcomes for cancer survivors ￼.
