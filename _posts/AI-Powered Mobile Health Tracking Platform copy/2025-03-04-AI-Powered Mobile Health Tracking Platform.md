#### Overview

I am developing a mobile data tracking and visualization platform specifically designed for researchers conducting studies on health and behavioral data.
This platform enables researchers to select, integrate, and visualize a variety of health data sourcesâ€”including data collected from Samsung Health, Google Fit, Apple Health, Fitbit, and manually entered dataâ€”tailored to the specific needs of their research projects.
A key feature of this platform is its modular architecture, which provides each data type and functionality as an independent plugin (module). This allows researchers to easily customize their data collection and analysis environment by adding or removing modules according to their research requirements.
