#### Overview


This project aims to develop and evaluate a novel mobile health (mHealth) visualization framework that enables effective and intuitive visualization of personal health data in mobile environments. While many existing mHealth applications rely on web-based or general-purpose mobile visualization tools, users often encounter significant limitations when visualizing data on mobile screens, making it difficult to efficiently explore and analyze information.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a mobile-specific visualization framework designed to deliver clear and intuitive representations, even within the limited screen space of mobile devices, while also supporting personalized interactions tailored to individual users.
